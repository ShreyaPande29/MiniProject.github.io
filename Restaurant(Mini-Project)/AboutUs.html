        Chinese food is widely available in India; is spicy, red, and greasy; and is mostly vegetarian or chicken/
        fish served with rice or noodles. It can neither be considered as an authentic Chinese food nor as Indian 
        food but falls into a new category called the Indian–Chinese cuisine. Historically, dietary culture in 
        India has been influenced by Tibetan–Mongolian culture, which was in turn influenced by the ancient Chinese
        cuisines modified to suit the ethnic food preferences and sensory likings [1]. However, widely available 
        popular Chinese foods do not have lineage to the Chinese-influenced Tibetan–Mongolian food. They can be 
        traced back to Chinese immigrants in Kolkata. Back in the late 19th century, people with the Hakka ancestry
        who lived in Kolkata introduced Hakka dishes to India. Later, only the name “Hakka” continues without change, 
        but the Hakka dishes have been changed to suit the Indian taste. In 1920, the first Chinese restaurant was 
        started in Kolkata by the Huang family that migrated from the Moi Yen village in southern China. They named 
        the restaurant Eau Chew, which was started as a low-cost tiffin place for the Chinese immigrants in Kolkata. 
        They served cutlets and pork chops for the European clients in British India [2]. Since then, many Chinese 
        restaurants have been started in Indian cities such as Mumbai (then Bombay) and Chennai (then Madras). The 
        foods that they serve were considered special and were exclusively available in few restaurants in these 
        cities. In the last decades of 20th century, Chinese food had become popular and was widely available 
        in the streets of Indian cities; small restaurants and street food places started serving it.
